0.8.5
    Parser#parse_compact_line now once again ignores beginning and ending delimiters. (Scott Patterson)
    Parser#parse_data now ignores header fields that are nil or blank when stripped. (Scott Patterson)
    Updated test to use the rets client version of the client, not hardcoded for post and get tests. (Scott Patterson)

0.8.4
    Fixed auth issue with authenticate headers with spaces after commas. (Ken Wiesner, Scott Patterson)
    When an exception is raised in the authentication parsing code, complain by raising
        a new exception, but also report anything of interest at the same time: request,
        response, response's body. (François Beausoleil)
    Fixed Client#request to actually respect the specified request method instead of always using GET requests. (Scott Patterson)
    Set default request method to POST since some RETS servers seem to have trouble with GET requests. (Scott Patterson)

0.8.3
    Added example #set_pre_request_block. (François Beausoleil)
    Allow a pre request block to be set for RETS4R::Client.
        This allows the caller to change the request in any meaningful way, such as adding a
        RETS-UA-Authorization header when appropriate. (François Beausoleil)
    Better response handling of HTTP errors. Response codes > 300 other than 401 now raise an
        HTTPError exception that encapsulates the HTTPResponse object.
        401 errors raise a LoginError exception. (Scott Patterson)
    Added in RETS specification error messages to reference. (Scott Patterson)
    New Rakefile.  Install the rake gem and do 'rake test' to run the tests. (François Beausoleil)

0.8.2
    Added missing result parameter to Client#search's yield (Scott Patterson)
    Added 1.7 to supported list and default version (François Beausoleil)
    No longer sends empty (nil) headers (François Beausoleil)
    Added debugging to HTTP output. (François Beausoleil, Scott Patterson)
    Added support for multiple set-cookie headers in the server response (François Beausoleil)
    Added basic search example (Scott Patterson)
    Implied default value of \t in RETS4R::Client::Transaction#delimiter (François Beausoleil)
    #get_metadata now returns the block's value or the results. (François Beausoleil)
    Made sure #login always calls #logout if called with a block.  #login returns the block's value
        instead of results. (François Beausoleil)
    New assertions that require Client to have Ruby-like accessors for attributes, instead of
        getters and setters.  Applied 'Rename Attribute' on @parser, because #get_parser_class
        was returning the class of the parser's class, instead of the parser's class itself. (François Beausoleil)
    Client#set_rets_version should take care to generate the correct RETS-Version header,
        and #get_rets_version should undo the changes that #set_rets_version did before
        returning the value. (François Beausoleil)
    Don't rescue an exception that's not being processed in Parser. (François Beausoleil)
    RETS4R::Client#get_object extensions: yield or return the array of DataObject instances;
        changed the multipart/parallel response boundary processing rules
        (include \r\n in the boundary detection); added documentation. (François Beausoleil)
    Added GetObject example (Scott Patterson)
    Changed #get_object now yields each DataObject if a block is given rather
        than an array of DataObjects (Scott Patterson)

0.8.1
    Added Action-URL support per the specification.
    Added a secondary_response accessor to the Transaction object, which is what the Action-URL result is stored in.
    Fixed a bug with loggers and parsers

0.8.0
    Fixed RParser support, which now means you can use REXML.
    RParser now retries XML that produced a parser error after trying to clean it.
    Parser support is now more open so that more parsers can be easily added in the future.
    Reorganized parser file layout.
    CParser will only be loaded if libxml (its dependency) is present. If it is, it is the default
        parser.
    Added more parser unit tests.
    Renamed CParser to XMLParser and RPARSER to REXML, both with the hierarchy RETS4R::Client::Module.
    Fixed a bug with the parser output not being set properly.
    Fixed a bug with the parser not respecting the DELIMITER value and insisting on tab delimiters.
    Added support for using a logger
    Added more defaults to the search options (Count => '0', Format => 'COMPACT')
    Added some Rubyisms (blocks can now be given to #new, #login, #get_metadata, #get_object, and #search)

0.7.1
    Added support for reading the results count for searches.
